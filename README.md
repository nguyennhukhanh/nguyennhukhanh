# 👋 &nbsp;Hi there

As a Web developer, I have a quick learning ability. My strengths lie in Web (Backend) development as well as a strong understanding of basic concepts of JavaScript, TypeScript. I understand what RESTful APIs, MVC, WebSocket and some other OOP Design Patterns are.
I am fairly proficient in some technologies such as: NodeJS/NestJS, React Native, MySQL, NoSQL(MongoDB)...
I have basic knowledge of source code management tool: GIT.
Efficiently manage independent projects, as well as collaborate in a team working environment.
